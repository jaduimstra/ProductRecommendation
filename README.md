Repository for source for product recommendation algorithms

`a_priori_triples.py` is the code for calculating the confidence of pair and triple itemsets in a text file.  It's based on the material from the Stanford class, [CS246](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs246/index.html).

See my [SlideShare deck](http://www.slideshare.net/JosephDuimstraPhD/product-recommendation-51881258) for an explanation of the topic.
